# Kent Maps Online project guides
## Adding useful images to Wikimedia

Wherever possible, we want to make the images that we use in the [Kent Maps Online](http://kent-maps.online) visual essays available for re-use via [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Wikimedia has **lots** of instructional pages about how to go about this, including:
* [Contributing your own work](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Contributing_your_own_work#Step_5:_Describing_the_file)
* [Project scope of Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope)
* [Choosing a license](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Choosing_a_license)
* [Geocoding](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Geocoding)
* [Permissions process where the uploader is not the copyright owner](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:OTRS)

The point of this guide is to make it as straightforward as possible for students to upload straightforward files with the creator's permission quickly and effectively. In particular, for example, we've established that the work of [Kent Maps Online](http://kent-maps.online) meets the educational purposes that form part of Wikimedia's scope, and we'll walk you through the process for managing permissions where the person doing the uploading is **not**the copyright owner. 

This guide largely follows the [Contributing your own work](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Contributing_your_own_work#Step_5:_Describing_the_file) instructions, although you're likely working with a picture that someone else has given us permission to put on Wikimedia and use on [Kent Maps Online](http://kent-maps.online). 

Because Wikimedia requires Creative Commons licenses, some images we have creator permission to use on our website, but not permission to post on Wikimedia. Double-check if you're ever unsure. It's better to take longer to get something online than accidentally upload something in breach of copyright!

### Before you begin

1. You'll need an account with Wikimedia Commons. If you already have an account with another Wiki site, like Wikipedia, you should be able to log in using that. If you don't, you'll have to create a new one via [Create an account](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Main+Page).
2. You should be sent one or more images from Michelle Crowther or Carolyn Oulton for uploading *to Wikimedia*. Check that you know which images are to be uploaded and that you know what they're pictures *of*. If that info isn't in the file title or explained to you beforehand, stop and ask! Note that you might also need to do a little research on specific locations that have different names used by locals and "official sources". For example, a picture of ["Boughton Church"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Peter_and_St_Paul,_Boughton,_Kent.jpg) makes sense to people who know the area, but people Googling it will find it's actually [St Peter and St Paul Church in Boughton-under-Blean, Kent](https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/11977/). So that's what it's been put under in Wikimedia.
3. Check that the files you've got are a format that Wikimedia's happy with. The file extensions should be JPEG (or JPG), GIF, PNG or TIFF.

If that's all good, move on!

### How-to (uploading)

1. Once you've logged in, you should see "Uploads" in the top right of your screen. Click this, and it should take you to the [Upload Wizard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard). If this is your first time here, you'll see a graphic about what you can upload to Wikimedia. Click "next" to go through into the main upload process.
2. You should find yourself with a blank upload page. Get started with your first image, either through drag-and-drop or by navigating through your folders with the select button. The upload might take a few minutes if the image is large. 
3. You can upload a number of files through one process, so if you have several related images to work on, this is worth doing now (as you can copy across some descriptive data on later pages). Use the "add more files" function if you want to do this, and click "Continue" once you're ready to move on.
4. Now you're onto the trickier bits! Unless this picture *is* your own work (e.g. a photograph you've taken of the landscape while on a walk), you want to choose the "This file is not my own work" button. A number of other boxes and buttons will now appear.
5. For source, enter: "Provided by {{Creator|\[Their Name and Surname\]}} to the Kent Maps Online project {{subst:OP}}", inserting the copyright owner's name in the square brackets. Add the copyright owner's name again in the "Author(s)" box using the same format ({{Creator|Name Surname}}).
7. For this project, we're using Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 as the standard license, so leave this box ticked (unless you've been told otherwise). Then click "next".
8. Now we come to the metadata for the image(s). It's important to provide a useful file name. This might be the location the picture shows, including the time of year if that's significant. You should also provide a short caption and a longer description that includes mention of the picture being provided to the Kent Maps Online project. Many photos will automatically have the date they were taken as part of their metadata, which will autocomplete. Don't worry if it says today's date, though. The date taken is not vital. You can ignore providing captions in additional languages (unless you really think it would be helpful and are fluent!). Try to find useful categories to which you can add your pictures. "Kent" is one, for example. 
9. If your pictures show a very specific landmark, click on the "Add location and more information..." link. Here we can add coordinates. Search for your location in Google maps (e.g. the Dungeness Lighthouse). When you've found it, you should be able to right-click on the red pin and Google will give you at the top of the new pop-up the latitude (first number) and longitude (second number) of the location. You can then enter these in the relevant boxes in the Upload Wizard, omitting the heading.
10. Click "Publish"!

### How-to (permissions)

1. Wikimedia allows some leeway in terms of when the copyright owner's permissions have to be received, but it's best to get this done as soon as possible.
2. The Wikimedia [Open-Ticket guidance](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:OTRS#If_you_are_NOT_the_copyright_holder) *sounds* as though you can forward an email from the copyright holder to them and get the permissions sorted. That's not been the case in my experience. Instead, ask the copyright holder to email permissions-commons@wikimedia.org, copying you in, with the following completed template email.

> I hereby affirm that I am \[name\], the creator of the exclusive copyright of choose one the media works as shown at the following URLs, which have been uploaded for me by \[your username\]: \[list all the URLs of the files you've uploaded on Wikimedia Commons for that person\] 
> I have legal authority in my capacity to release the copyright of that work, and I agree to publish the above-mentioned content under the following free license: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International
> I acknowledge that by doing so I grant anyone the right to use the work, even in a commercial product or otherwise, and to modify it according to their needs, provided that they abide by the terms of the license and any other applicable laws.
> I am aware that this agreement is not limited to Wikipedia or related sites.
> I am aware that the copyright holder always retains ownership of the copyright as well as the right to be attributed in accordance with the license chosen. Modifications others make to the work will not be claimed to have been made by the copyright holder.
> I acknowledge that I cannot withdraw this agreement, and that the content may or may not be kept permanently on a Wikimedia project.
> \[Sender's name\], Copyright Holder, \[Date\]

3. To make this work, the email has to be very specific. You'll therefore need to provide the copyright holder with all of the right URLs for where their photos now live in Wikimedia. You can find these by logging in to Wikimedia and going to "Uploads" at the very top-right of the page. This will tkae you to a list of all the pictures you have uploaded onto Wikimedia, from which you can copy and paste the URLs to share with the copyright holder.
4. If they require additional information from the copyright holder, Wikimedia will then ask for it. 
5. When they've accepted and processed the permissions, Wikimedia volunteers will add to your page that Wikimedia has received correspondence about copyright permissions and holds it in the permissions archive. There's nothing for you to do here.
6. A sidenote on permissions: where we're uploading photographs of paintings, there are some complications depending on who took the photograph and who did the painting. You'll get extra guidance about this if it happens!
