# Kent Maps Online project guides
## Adding useful images to Wikimedia

Wherever possible, we want to make the images that we use in the [Kent Maps Online](http://kent-maps.online) visual essays available for re-use via [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Wikimedia has **lots** of instructional pages about how to go about this, including:
* [Contributing your own work](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Contributing_your_own_work#Step_5:_Describing_the_file)
* [Project scope of Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope)
* [Choosing a license](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Choosing_a_license)
* [Geocoding](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Geocoding)
* []()

The point of this guide is to make it as straightforward as possible for students to upload straightforward files with the creator's permission quickly and effectively. 

This guide largely follows the [Contributing your own work](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Contributing_your_own_work#Step_5:_Describing_the_file) instructions, although you're likely working with a picture that someone else has given us permission to put on Wikimedia and use on [Kent Maps Online](http://kent-maps.online).

### Before you begin

1. You'll need an account with Wikimedia Commons. If you already have an account with another Wiki site, like Wikipedia, you should be able to log in using that. If you don't, you'll have to create a new one via [Create an account](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Main+Page).

2. You should be sent one or more images from Michelle Crowther or Carolyn Oulton for uploading. Check that you know which ones are to be uploaded and that you know what they're pictures *of*. If that info isn't in the file title or explained to you beforehand, stop and ask!

3. Check that the files you've got are a format that Wikimedia's happy with. The file extensions should be JPEG (or JPG), GIF, PNG or TIFF.

If that's all good, move on!

### How-to

1. Once you've logged in, you should see "Uploads" in the top right of your screen.
